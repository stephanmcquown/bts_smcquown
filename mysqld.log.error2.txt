diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed,

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed,

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed,

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed,

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 3149067 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

terribly wrong...

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.
