## Goal

I would like to attain the Oracle MySQL DBA Certificate.  This would benefit National Oak as it covers areas which I currently have limited knowledge of.  Much of this will allow us to scale as business grows.  MySQL is or course free vs Microsoft SQL Server and it's the native database storage for Perfection.  Uber uses it too.
