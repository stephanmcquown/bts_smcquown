# Fundamentals of Comp Sci

Programming started in 1945

*Algorithm*: step by step instructions to solve a problem
Human readable code in compiled into binary (0s1s)
*Programming*: instructions the computer will follow
*Stack*: Contiguous block of memory that deallocates automatically; stores local variables and parameters
*Heap*: Memory allocated by programmer (and deallocated); stores objects IE reference instances; stores static fields and constants

# 5 Generations of Programming Languages

1. Machine Language: Only language computer can understand; data as binary (first programmers wrote in this)
2. Assembly Language: Allows words instead of binary but strong relationship between the instructions in the language and machine code instructions; designed for one specific computer architecture
3. High Level Language: Modern languages IE C# Python
4. Problem Oriented Languages: IE SQL
5. Natural Languages: Used for machine learning
